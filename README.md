# VirtualEye - LifeGuard for Swimming Pools to Detect Active Drowning
An AI based active drowning detection system that utilized YOLOv5 to detect swimmers and track their movements to check for drowning swimmers. If a drowning person is detected, the system triggers an alarm and notifies the life guard. The proposed system can detect drowning persons with an accuracy of 97%. This project is developed as part of my Bachelor's degree coursework.
